## Description:

This is a front-end website project I created about my favorite music genre classic rock music which includes news and history about the music and artists. I created this website from scratch using GIMP to create the header, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the layout and responsiveness of the site, CSS animations for the animations, and JavaScript for the functionality for the mobile navigation in tablets and smartphones and for the functionality of the band and artist search engine I added on the site.
