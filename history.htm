  <h4>About</h4>
    <p>
      Classic rock is a radio format of rock music that features music ranging 
      generally from the 1950's to the 1990's. It developed from the album-oriented rock
      format in the early 1980's. The format can be found on rock radio stations, which 
      are most popular among older audiences because of the familiar rock and roll hits
      from the past. Some radio stations even include older rock hits with newer ones to
      attempt to appeal to younger audiences.

    The early 1950's were dominated by vocalists, such as Doris Day. Frankie Lane,
    Frank Sinatra, Rosemary Clooney, and Nat King Cole and band leaders Mitch Miller,
    Percy Faith, and others. The solid body electric guitar became commercially 
    available in the early 1950's and quickly became popular among music artists. The 
    78 RPM record was replaced by the long playing vinyl album and the 45 RPM single 
    was introduced. 1953 saw Bill Haley and the Comets hit the pop charts with their 
    rock single "Crazy Man Crazy" at #12. In 1955 Bill Haley's "Rock Around The Clock"
    topped the Pop Charts at #1. In April of 1956 Elvis Presley topped the Pop Charts
    with his first single release "Heartbreak Hotel" and he also the first artist to
    have nine singles in the Hot 100 at one time that year. By 1957 rock and roll
    artists were appearing regularly on the popular music charts and by 1959 rock and
    roll records were accounting for 43 percent of all music records sold. Tragedy 
    struck in 1959 as rock stars Buddy Holly, Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens were killed
    in a plane crash.

    In the 1960s rock music became very popular and dominated the music charts.
    The early 1960s saw Elvis Presley continuing to shine with big time hits, along 
    with girl groups, such as The Supremes, Dixie Cups, and others, surf music, such as
    The Beach Boys and the Motown, Stax, and Atlantic labels brought many african-american
    artists back to the pop charts. In 1964 the pop charts were led by bands, such as the
    Beatles and The Rolling Stones. Music in the 1960's evolved into more social and 
    political statements and reflected on the growing hippie culture. Rock bands and 
    their music began to be showcased on prime time television on the Ed Sullivan Show 
    and other variety shows. Outdoor rock music festivals began in the late sixties, 
    beginning with the Monterey Pop Festival, a three day event which attracted 55,000
    fans per day. In the summer of 1969, the Woodstock Festival drew 500,000 people to a
    three day concert in Bethel, New York. The sixties were dominated by the Beatles, 
    which had 6 of the top 10 albums of the decade and 21 of the decade's top 100 singles.
    Elvis Presley had 9 of the decade's top 100 singles and 4 of the decade's top 100 albums.

    The seventies start off with the break up of the Beatles in 1970 but all
    four members continue with successful solo careers. The early part of the
    decade saw the deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Jim Morrison who
    all died at the young age of 27. Many bands move from playing in clubs and
    theatres, to playing in sports arenas and outdoor stadiums. Many of the big
    time bands such as Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, and the Who
    formed in the 1960's continued to see success in the seventies. Car stereos started
    to emerge, which featured FM radio along with 8-Track tape players and then 
    eventually cassette tape players. Disco and punk rock music began to emerge
    and dominated the later part of the decade. In 1977 Elvis Presley known as
    the "King of Rock" died at the age of 42.

    The 1990s was a decade summed up by metal bands, alternative rock, industrial rock, punk rock, and
    rap metal, becoming very popular with their audiences. In 1990,
    Metal rock band Metallica, who saw success in the eighties, released their very 
    successful "Black Album" in 1990. A year later Guns N Roses released their double 
    album "Use Your Illusion I/II. Alternative bands such as REM, The Smashing Pumpkins, 
    Red Hot Chilli Peppers and rock bands such as Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Soundgarden, 
    and Pearl Jam and others became popular and successful. In 1994 the tragic death of 
    Nirvana's front man and guitarist Kurt Cobain pretty much dissolved the band, yet their
    music remained popular. Not long afterward alternative rock bands such as Green Day 
    with the release of their album "Dookie", Goo Goo Dolls, Blink 182, and others saw much success
    and popularity.
